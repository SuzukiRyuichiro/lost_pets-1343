## Context

Today, students learned how to make basic CRUD actions on a model. The goal of this livecode is to rehearse the 7 CRUD actions in Rails.

To do this, weâ€™re going to create an app to report and list lost pets.

- As a user I can see all found pets
- As a user I can see details about one found pet (when and where it was found)
- As a user I can add a pet I found
- As a user I can update a pet
- As a user I can delete a pet
